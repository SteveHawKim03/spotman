# spotman
Initial build for Netflix Marmaduke Animation; move the spotlight to follow the object more realistically as if the spotlight is handled by a human.
Applied logistic growth model and restricted model.
Paste this function into your scene's script editor. Keep in mind that you should have already created your spotlight before applying this code.
